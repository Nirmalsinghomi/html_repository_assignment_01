    <h1>so this is the answer of my 1st question------->HTML defines the content and structures of your website</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Now the answer of 2nd quesion------->so in this question i have to use comment tag and explain its purpose so i have explained it as an comment , you can check in the view page source.</p>
    <!-- Explaining the purpose of comments in HTML and providing an example of how to use comments in an html document -->
    <!-- This is also an exapmle of comments --> 
    <hr>
    <p>now this is the answer of my 3rd question</p>
    <h1>this is a heading, the important one</h1>
    <br>
    <p>and above i used a break tag to break the line and below too</p>
    <br>
    <p>and this is an paragraph of text and below this i used a horizontal line (tag) </p>
    <hr>
    <hr>
    <p>So the 4th question is that i have to write a short note on tag and elements with an example so i am using paragraph tag.</p> <br>
    <p>Tag are types of format that we used in coding to create structures and to make a beautiful and useful webpage.</p> <br>
    <p>There are different types of tags used for different purpose.</p> <br>
    <p>But there are mainly two types of tags , the opening tag and the closing tag and if we put some content inside these tags , then the whole things is called the element. </p> <hr>
    <p>And my 5th question is that what is the DOCTYPE declaration in HTML?</p> <br>
    <p>So the doctype declaration in HTML is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in..</p> <hr>
